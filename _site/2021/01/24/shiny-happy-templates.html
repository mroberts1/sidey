Part of my job involved authoring an online study guide on academic writing in English for the center’s website. The process began with me authoring documents in Microsoft Word, which after receiving the director’s approval were outsourced to a web design company that converted them to HTML documents and uploaded them to the center’s website. I wasn’t too happy either with the generic design of the website or the absence of control over the design process itself, and for the first time in years began experimenting with authoring content directly to web pages. Abandoning Microsoft Word other than for editing author manuscripts, I switched more or less overnight to authoring documents in <a href="https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown</a> and converting them to whatever format was needed, whether docx, html, or pdf. I discovered that unlike people in humanities fields who continue to struggle with MS Word bloatware, scientists have been using Latex for decades to author beautifully-formatted manuscripts. I finally, belatedly discovered the work of <a href="https://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/courses">Edward Tufte</a>, whose name I’d sporadically come across over previous decades but whose contribution to the field of visual design I’ve only come to realize over the past year. I was particularly taken with the exquisite design of Tufte’s books and website, and - again for the first time - began scouring typography websites and hunting down font libraries to improve on the lackluster fonts that are standard on most websites.</p><p>I started by exploring the proliferating field of minimalist, “distraction-free” writing apps, whether standalone like <a href="https://www.sublimetext.com/">Sublime Text</a> or <a href="https://ia.net/writer">iA / Writer</a>, or the growing number of browser-based apps like <a href="https://write.as/">Write.as</a> or <a href="https://www.sigle.io/">Sigle</a>. The Javascript-based online apps looked cool and were designed to be as easy to use as possible, but I couldn’t take to them, and every one I tried seemed to have some limitation that led me to move on to another one: as soon as I tentatively tried a sample post or two, I would run into some design element I didn’t like but couldn’t change. It quickly became obvious that what I really wanted was greater agency in deciding how my content looked, rather than just pouring it into predesigned templates.</p><p>By now I’d begun to fall down a number of other rabbit holes that seemed to be offer something closer to what I was looking for: <a href="https://rstudio.com/">RStudio</a>, an authoring environment that automated the process of generating PDF documents, <a href="https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/">websites</a>, and even entire <a href="https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/">books</a> from Markdown documents; <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>, another blog-authoring framework with an extensive library of themes; and <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a>, Jekyll’s cooler younger brother. While web-design apps like <a href="https://wordpress.com/">Wordpress</a> streamlined the design process to the point that it became like painting by numbers, frameworks like Jekyll and Hugo required use of the command line interface, which I’d used long before and felt I still knew my way around, kind of. I even had a <a href="https://github.com/mroberts1">GitHub account</a>, although at the time still had little idea what to do with it. Gradually, as the spring evenings wore on, I reached the decision that what I really needed to do was to get back into web development. After all, wasn’t this long overdue? Hadn’t I started out authoring HTML pages and websites myself in the very earliest days of the web? Hadn’t I used blogs as a teaching tool when I taught courses on interactive media in the early 2000s? Wouldn’t it be worthwhile to catch up on what had been going on in web design over the two decades since I’d been making little websites with Dreamweaver? It was high time I established some kind of online presence. Like many people, I was becoming increasingly disillusioned with social media and the corporate takeover of the web, yet most people in my field continued to use the walled gardens of platform capitalism. Every alternative I looked into reassured me how easy it all was: everbody else, it seemed, was hosting blogs, generating static websites, building wikis. I was late to the party, as usual, but I still wanted to join it. So I decided to go back to web development.</p><p>And that’s where my troubles really started.</p><span class="meta"><time datetime="2021-01-24T00:00:00-05:00">January 24, 2021</time> &middot; <a href="/tag/webdev">webdev</a></span></section></main></body></html>
