assured us, as if the discussion ended there.</p><p>As if this were somehow common knowledge, that we should have known about.</p><p>As if we should have known this already, even though we had not visited the airport since returning from a year-long trip to South Korea last July, along with the millions of other passengers who have not been passing through it either due to the Covid-19 pandemic.</p><p>As if it was perfectly acceptable for a major international airport to offer no Economy parking for long-term international travellers, while continuing to charge the same much higher rates for the only remaining Short-term parking lot, leaving those unwilling or unable to pay short-term rates for long-term travel to the mercies of the proliferating private lots around the airport’s perimeter.</p><p>As if we should have thought to double-check on the airport website, before leaving, to make sure that it was, indeed, still open, even though we’d been using it for many years and had no reason to believe that the Economy parking garage of a major international airport would simply have been shut down when we arrived.</p><p>As if it was unproblematic that in spite of shutting down the Economy lot, the Logan parking authority was nevertheless still justified in maintaining its existing, far more expensive rates in its Short-term parking lot, even though the major international airport no longer offered long-term travellers any cheaper alternative.</p><p>As if this now justified the Logan parking authority charging us almost $1,900 for parking our car for the past six weeks in the only remaining lot of this major international airport, while we travelled to South Korea to attend the funeral of my wife’s deceased father, followed by weeks of enforced quarantine, Covid tests, and hospital visits to address my wife’s health issues.</p><p>As if we had not been travelling in an emergency situation, leaving literally the day after finding out  that my wife’s father had passed away on the other side of the planet, mistakenly and naïvely assuming that the Economy parking lot would be available as usual when we arrived.</p><p>As if, having found the Economy lot to be closed, we had not then missed our flight due to the delay of having to drive back at what was now, we realized too late, the only  available parking lot at this major international airport.</p><p>As if, in the midst of frantically packing to leave immediately for a six-week international trip as a result of a family emergency, we should have still had the presence of mind to double-check on the airport website, to make sure that the Economy lot that we had been using since as long as we have been using the airport itself, was, indeed, still open.</p><p>In short, as if none of the circumstances in which we had departed, as if the fact that we had missed our flight in part as a result of wrongly assuming that the Economy lot would not be closed, simply did not matter.</p><p>For the parking supervisor, literally none of this was of the slightest importance. The only thing that mattered was that we had parked our car in the Short-term lot for six weeks, and now had to pay for doing so. The Economy lot had been closed for over a year; we were expected to know this before traveling, or at least to have double-checked beforehand, irrespective of irrelevant details  like family emergencies.</p><p>We could not afford to pay that amount, we said. We had unexpectedly had to prolong our trip in Seoul and delay our return due to my wife’s hospital visits. Given the circumstances, was there any chance of reducing the fee a little, or at least offering some kind of payment plan?</p><p>The African-American supervisor asked what was the minimum that we thought we could pay right now, so that after six weeks of hell we could get our car out of the parking lot and finally go home. My wife suggested $500, which was immediately rejected.</p><p>The supervisor went to call his boss. It was suggested that if we could pay $1300, we could then be billed for the remaining amount. Since there was no alternative, my wife went off in search of an ATM to move funds around.</p><p>She returned with $500 in cash as  partial payment, but charging the remaining $1300+ to her Korean credit card was declined. She gave her U.S. bank card, and the supervisor proceeded to charge the full amount on it. It went through. The supervisor declared, “so you could pay after all!,” oblivious to the fact that the amount that he had just withdrawn from the account was required for the monthly mortgage payment on our house.</p><p>Now that the full amount had been paid, after almost an hour of unsuccessful pleading, we were free to leave and go home.</p><p>Capitalism is merciless: you use a service, you pay for it, end of story. There are no extenuating circumstances.</p><p>Yet things are not that simple, and the implacability of the parking authority is not a universal truth that we should have understood before we even left. I cannot believe that exactly the same thing would have happened in the society that we had just returned from, South Korea. People in service positions there are reasonable, they care, they listen to you, and if the circumstances warrant it they are willing to make exceptions. They behave like human beings rather than like robots afraid of getting fired for not following the rules.</p><p>Korean companies recognize that commerce is not just a matter of extracting the maximum surplus value from their customers, by any means possible or necessary. They understand that human relationships matter, and affect future business - or the loss of it.</p><p>Even in the current economic crisis resulting from the health crisis of a global pandemic, that a major international airport should not provide an economy parking lot for  long-term international travellers, requiring them to pay short-term rates unless they have time to use external private contractors, is already a matter of public concern.</p><p>That the parking authority itself, even in the case of a demonstrable  family emergency, with all of the distress that this already provides, should not only callously ignore such circumstances but also hold passengers responsible for a situation the authority itself has created, is disgraceful.</p><p>It goes without saying that we will never again park our car in the only remaining parking lot at Logan International Airport, whether for family emergencies or any other reason. The people there have no interest in personal anecdotes. They provide a service, you pay for it, they get their paycheck.</p><p>But even if they have no interest in hearing our story, they cannot prevent us from telling it to anyone willing to listen, and expressing our disgust at how we were treated after a traumatic international trip, so that they, at least, will understand. And we will take every available opportunity to exercise our right to do so.</p><span class="meta"><time datetime="2021-02-06T00:00:00-05:00">February 6, 2021</time> &middot; <a href="/tag/travel">travel</a></span></section></main></body></html>
