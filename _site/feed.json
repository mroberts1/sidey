The only thing that mattered was that we had parked our car in the Short-term lot for six weeks, and now had to pay for doing so. The Economy lot had been closed for over a year; we were expected to know this before traveling, or at least to have double-checked beforehand, irrespective of irrelevant details  like family emergencies.We could not afford to pay that amount, we said. We had unexpectedly had to prolong our trip in Seoul and delay our return due to my wife’s hospital visits. Given the circumstances, was there any chance of reducing the fee a little, or at least offering some kind of payment plan?The African-American supervisor asked what was the minimum that we thought we could pay right now, so that after six weeks of hell we could get our car out of the parking lot and finally go home. My wife suggested $500, which was immediately rejected.The supervisor went to call his boss. It was suggested that if we could pay $1300, we could then be billed for the remaining amount. Since there was no alternative, my wife went off in search of an ATM to move funds around.She returned with $500 in cash as  partial payment, but charging the remaining $1300+ to her Korean credit card was declined. She gave her U.S. bank card, and the supervisor proceeded to charge the full amount on it. It went through. The supervisor declared, “so you could pay after all!,” oblivious to the fact that the amount that he had just withdrawn from the account was required for the monthly mortgage payment on our house.Now that the full amount had been paid, after almost an hour of unsuccessful pleading, we were free to leave and go home.Capitalism is merciless: you use a service, you pay for it, end of story. There are no extenuating circumstances.Yet things are not that simple, and the implacability of the parking authority is not a universal truth that we should have understood before we even left. I cannot believe that exactly the same thing would have happened in the society that we had just returned from, South Korea. People in service positions there are reasonable, they care, they listen to you, and if the circumstances warrant it they are willing to make exceptions. They behave like human beings rather than like robots afraid of getting fired for not following the rules.Korean companies recognize that commerce is not just a matter of extracting the maximum surplus value from their customers, by any means possible or necessary. They understand that human relationships matter, and affect future business - or the loss of it.Even in the current economic crisis resulting from the health crisis of a global pandemic, that a major international airport should not provide an economy parking lot for  long-term international travellers, requiring them to pay short-term rates unless they have time to use external private contractors, is already a matter of public concern.That the parking authority itself, even in the case of a demonstrable  family emergency, with all of the distress that this already provides, should not only callously ignore such circumstances but also hold passengers responsible for a situation the authority itself has created, is disgraceful.It goes without saying that we will never again park our car in the only remaining parking lot at Logan International Airport, whether for family emergencies or any other reason. The people there have no interest in personal anecdotes. They provide a service, you pay for it, they get their paycheck.But even if they have no interest in hearing our story, they cannot prevent us from telling it to anyone willing to listen, and expressing our disgust at how we were treated after a traumatic international trip, so that they, at least, will understand.

            "content_text": "A year in web designIn the Spring of last year, while working at a university writing center in Jeonju, South Korea, I unexpectedly found myself with a lot of free evenings. Part of my job involved authoring an online study guide on academic writing in English for the center’s website. The process began with me authoring documents in Microsoft Word, which after receiving the director’s approval were outsourced to a web design company that converted them to HTML documents and uploaded them to the center’s website. I wasn’t too happy either with the generic design of the website or the absence of control over the design process itself, and for the first time in years  began experimenting with authoring content directly to web pages. Abandoning Microsoft Word other than for editing author manuscripts, I switched more or less overnight to authoring documents in Markdown and converting them to whatever format was needed, whether docx, html, or pdf. I discovered that unlike people in humanities fields who continue to struggle with MS Word bloatware, scientists have been using Latex for decades to author beautifully-formatted manuscripts. I finally, belatedly discovered the work of Edward Tufte, whose name I’d sporadically come across over previous decades but whose contribution to the field of visual design I’ve only come to realize over the past year. I was particularly taken with the exquisite design of Tufte’s books and website, and - again for the first time - began scouring typography websites and hunting down font libraries to improve on the lackluster fonts that are standard on most websites.I started by exploring the proliferating field of minimalist, “distraction-free” writing apps, whether standalone like Sublime Text or iA / Writer, or the growing number of browser-based apps like Write.as or Sigle. The Javascript-based online apps looked cool and were designed to be as easy to use as possible, but I couldn’t take to them, and every one I tried seemed to have some limitation that led me to move on to another one: as soon as I tentatively tried a sample post or two, I would run into some design element I didn’t like but couldn’t change. It quickly became obvious that what I really wanted was greater agency in deciding how my content looked, rather than just pouring it into predesigned templates.By now I’d begun to fall down a number of other rabbit holes that seemed to be offer something closer to what I was looking for: RStudio, an authoring environment that automated the process of generating PDF documents, websites, and even entire books from Markdown documents; Jekyll, another blog-authoring framework with an extensive library of themes; and Hugo, Jekyll’s cooler younger brother. While web-design apps like Wordpress streamlined the design process to the point that it became like painting by numbers, frameworks like Jekyll and Hugo required use of the command line interface, which I’d used long before and felt I  still knew my way around, kind of. I even had a GitHub account, although at the time still had little idea what to do with it. Gradually, as the spring evenings wore on, I reached the decision that what I really needed to do was to get back into web development. After all, wasn’t this long overdue? Hadn’t I started out authoring HTML pages and websites myself in the very earliest days of the web? Hadn’t I used blogs as a teaching tool when I taught courses on interactive media in the early 2000s? Wouldn’t it be worthwhile to catch up on what had been going on in web design over the two decades since I’d been making little websites with Dreamweaver? It was high  time I established some kind of online presence. Like many people, I was becoming increasingly disillusioned with social media and the corporate takeover of the web, yet most people in my field continued to use the walled gardens of platform capitalism. Every alternative I looked into reassured me how easy it all was: everbody else, it seemed, was hosting blogs, generating static websites, building wikis. I was late to the party, as usual, but I still wanted to join it. So I decided to go back to web development.And that’s where my troubles really started.",

            "content_text": "Monday 18 January 2021I’m riding in the front passenger seat of my sister-in-law’s pure-white  Hyundai Grandeur on the way to my wife’s hospital appointment early on a Monday morning, cruising though commuter traffic in Seoul, along a tributary of the great Han river that flows through the city. The car is new and its  dashboard is state-of-the-art: the widescreen navigation system is the size of my laptop and auto-zooms in and out as we approach intersections, while the on-board entertainment module looks like the interface of a home theater system. As the urban landscape scrolls smoothly past in an endless loop of high-rise apartment complexes and riverside exercise parks, I watch the other, very similar black and white cars gliding smoothly around us, and find myself wondering what all this will look like a hundred years from now. And it occurs to me that it will probably not look all that different from how it does today. There will still be no flying cars, for the same economic and logistical reasons there are no flying cars now; cars themselves will almost certainly still be around, though, powered by today’s alternative energy sources: electric, hydrogen, solar (probably still not wind). The apartment villages will also likely still be around, in higher, more futuristic form. In spite of a century of further global warming, viral pandemics, and inevitably, wars; in spite of the continued expansion of environmentally-responsible, low-tech, post-capitalist lifestyles, centuries-old habits die hard. As my sister-in-law’s car shows, while technologies change, in modern societies human needs remain pretty consistent: automation, seamless mobility, continuous connectivity, convenience stores, online shopping, home delivery, streaming entertainment. In many ways, the hikikomori life under lockdown over the past year has already given us a preview of what life will be like in the coming century: biocitizenship, social control, auto-surveillance, remote interfaces. Welcome to the future. On our network screens, people keep reminding us that even when the present pandemic ends - if it even does - life from now on will never be the same as it was before. Because one guy twenty years ago concealed a bomb in his shoe before boarding an airliner, we now all have to go barefoot through airport security.In thinking about the future, we tend to forget the inertia of the status quo: a kind of structural viscosity that is resistant to sudden social transformation and seeks to preserve existing power and economic relations. We know that such transformations can happen and have happened historically, of course, but in the larger scheme of things they belong to the same order as earthquakes or plane crashes: freak events that are catastrophic but relatively rare.So ultimately, I don’t think speculating about the future, either in utopian or dystopian terms, is all that interesting, because I think the future - at least the foreseeable future -  is going to look very much like the present, albeit with cooler-looking technology. At this point, modernity is a train that has come off the tracks, but continues to plough on regardlessly: while capitalist realism may be an ideology, as Mark Fisher has convincingly demonstrated, modernity itself is a much larger vehicle, a juggernaut driven by economic logics rather than ethical or environmental concerns. In this still modern, capitalist world, it remains  unimaginable that a hundred years from now the high-rise complexes, the freeways, the commuter traffic, and the exercise parks will have been replaced by an arcadia of green spaces, intentional communities, solarpunk bike messengers, non-plastic-clogged oceans, and resurgent animal species. Some of these things will hopefully exist parallel to the viscous world, of course, and we must not relax our efforts to achieve them. But achieving them will require a continuous struggle against the forces of inertia, the vested interests of the political and economic incumbents. And we should be under no illusions about the forces of inertia that any effort to imagine - let alone realize - a less alienating, more just, more fulfilling world will be up against.Forty years ago, the French social theorist and arch-provocateur Jean Baudrillard, in a typical act of philosophical heresy, invited us to forget the work of the great social historian Michel Foucault, in a work simply titled in English Forget Foucault (the French Oublier Foucault, “forgetting Foucault,” is less blunt). To propose a similar act of forgetting in the case of the future might seem perverse, given that forgetting itself is something that in theory at least could only be done to something that has already happened, not what has not yet happened. But the future itself has a history, and that history shows that we have been wrong about the future many times before. So that is why I propose that we need to forget about the future, remember that we live only in the present, and focus on improving things there first, if we are to make a better world, whether tomorrow or a hundred years from now.",

Some of these things will hopefully exist parallel to the viscous world, of course, and we must not relax our efforts to achieve them. But achieving them will require a continuous struggle against the forces of inertia, the vested interests of the political and economic incumbents. And we should be under no illusions about the forces of inertia that any effort to imagine - let alone realize - a less alienating, more just, more fulfilling world will be up against.</p><p>Forty years ago, the French social theorist and arch-provocateur Jean Baudrillard, in a typical act of philosophical heresy, invited us to forget the work of the great social historian Michel Foucault, in a work simply titled in English <a href=\"http://semiotexte.com/?p=704\"><em>Forget Foucault</em></a> (the French <em>Oublier Foucault</em>, “forgetting Foucault,” is less blunt). To propose a similar act of forgetting in the case of the future might seem perverse, given that forgetting itself is something that in theory at least could only be done to something that has already happened, not what has not yet happened. But the future itself has a history, and that history shows that we have been wrong about the future many times before. So that is why I propose that we need to forget about the future, remember that we live only in the present, and focus on improving things there first, if we are to make a better world, whether tomorrow or a hundred years from now.</p>",
